Documentation is done through the following rules:
    1. Normal documentation will be done as usual
    2. In addition, files may include:
        a. A quick summary of their purpose (in the format of ???.py: asdf)
            Ex: common.py: contains the website settings not for solely development/production

        b. Required files used in the code somewhere and usage in that code
        (in the format of Requires:???.py in: asdf)
            Ex: Requires: urls.py (under uwhvz) in: ROOT_URLCONF = 'uwhvz.urls

        c. Files the current file is used in
        (in the format of Used in:???.py in: asdf)
            Ex: Used in: development.py in: from .common import *

        Note to b & c: if the named file is not within the same folder, its location will be
        in the (), as well if it is a folder instead of a program file
            Ex: app (folder, main folder); (is folder?, location)
                development.py; located in same folder as current file
